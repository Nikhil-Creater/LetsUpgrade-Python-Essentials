A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It's default functions are append() , clear() , insert() , pop() , remove() etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element and dictionary holds key value pair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It's default functions are get() , copy() , popitem() , update() , values() etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Sets are used for storing unique value in the python and sets are complex data structure and Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It's default functions are add() , discard() , remove() , pop() , clear() etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It's explore default methods are count() , index() etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is a derived data type. Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed. They create a copy of a string which they modify and return to the caller.
